## Contracts

The architecture is built around a series of smart contracts, categorized into these main types:

- **Registry Contract**: [Registry.cash](#registry)

- **Operational Contracts**: [Auction.cash](#auction), [Bid.cash](#bid), [DomainFactory.cash](#domainfactory)

- **Guard Contracts**: [AuctionNameEnforcer.cash](#auctionnameenforcer), [DomainOwnershipGuard.cash](#domainownershipguard), [AuctionConflictResolver.cash](#auctionconflictresolver)

- **Domain Contract**: [Domain.cash](#3-domain)

- **Accumulator Contract**: [Accumulator.cash](#accumulator)


### Registry

The Registry contract functions as the control and storage hub. Operational, Guard, and Accumulator contracts must execute their transactions in conjunction with the Registry contract.
This contract holds [RegistrationNFTs](#registrationnfts), [AuctionNFTs](#auctionnft), and [AuthorizedThreadNFTs](#authorizedthreadnfts).

Constructor:
- `domainCategory`: The category of the domain. (e.g `.bch` or `.sat`). All the NFTs in the system belong to this category.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) NFT with authorized contract's locking bytecode as commitment from self | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to self + (optionally tokenAmount from auctionNFT input) |
| 1 | Any UTXO from Authorized contract | UTXO back to Authorized contract |

Note: The actual number and structure of inputs/outputs and covenants beyond this pair is controlled by the authorized contract being used.

### Operational Contracts

#### Auction

The Auction contract lets anyone start a new auction.
Each auction requires:
   - A minimum starting bid of at least `minStartingBid` BCH
   - It must run for at least `minWaitTime`(In the DomainFactory contract). The timer resets with a new bid

Constructor:
- `minStartingBid`: The minimum starting bid of the auction.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) NFT with authorized contract's locking bytecode as commitment from [Registry Contract](#registry) | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to [Registry Contract](#registry) |
| 1 | Any UTXO from self | Back to self |
| 2 | [RegistrationNFTs](#registrationnfts) Counter NFT | [RegistrationNFTs](#registrationnfts) Counter NFT, with nftCommitment incremented by 1 and tokenAmount decreased by NewRegistrationID |
| 3 | Funding UTXO from bidder | [AuctionNFT](#auctionnft) |
| 4 | | OP_RETURN revealing the name |
| 5 | | Optional change in BCH |


#### Bid

The Bid contract allows anyone to bid on an active auction by allowing restricted manipulation of auctionNFT. It updates the `satoshisValue` and the `pkh` in the `nftCommitment`. The only condition is that the new Bid amount must be at least `minBidIncreasePercentage` higher.

Constructor:
- `minBidIncreasePercentage`: The minimum percentage increase in the bid amount.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) NFT with authorized contract's locking bytecode as commitment from [Registry Contract](#registry) | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to [Registry Contract](#registry) |
| 1 | Any UTXO from Authorized contract | UTXO back to Authorized contract |
| 2 | [AuctionNFT](#auctionnft) | [AuctionNFT](#auctionnft) with increased amount and updated commitment |
| 3 | Funding UTXO from new bidder | Previous bid amount returned to previous bidder |
| 4 | | Optional change to new bidder |


#### DomainFactory

The DomainFactory burns the auctionNFT and issues 3 new NFTs [DomainNFTs](#domainnfts). It verifies that the actionNFT input is at least `minWaitTime` old. It also attaches the tokenAmount from auctionNFT to the authorized contract's thread.

Constructor:
- `domainContractBytecode`: The partial bytecode of the domain contract that has an Owner.
- `minWaitTime`: The minimum wait time in blocks to consider an auction ended.
- `maxPlatformFeePercentage`: The maximum fee percentage that can be charged by the platform.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) NFT with authorized contract's locking bytecode as commitment from [Registry Contract](#registry) | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to [Registry Contract](#registry) + tokenAmount from auctionNFT input|
| 1 | Any UTXO from self | Back to self |
| 2 | [RegistrationNFT](#registrationnfts) Domain Minting NFT | [RegistrationNFT](#registrationnfts) Domain Minting NFT back to registry contract |
| 3 | [AuctionNFT](#auctionnft) | [DomainNFT](#domainnfts) External Auth NFT |
| 4 | | [DomainNFT](#domainnfts) Internal Auth NFT |
| 5 | | [DomainNFT](#domainnfts) Ownership NFT|
| 6 | | Platform fee and rest to miners |


### Guard Contracts

These contracts serve the purpose of incentivizing the enforcement of the rules. For example, if someone were to start a registration for a domain that is already owned then the [DomainOwnershipGuard](#domainownershipguard) contract will authorize anyone to provide proof of ownership of the domain using [External Auth DomainNFT](#domainnfts) and penalize the illegal auction by burning the auctionNFT and giving the funds to the proof provider.

Similarly, other contracts also provide a way to authorize anyone to penalize anyone who attempts to break the rules of the system


#### AuctionNameEnforcer

The AuctionNameEnforcer contract allows anyone to prove that the running auction has an invalid domain name. By providing proof (index of the invalid character) they burn the auctionNFT, taking away the entire amount as a reward.

> **INFO:** The nature of this architecture is that it allows for more types of restrictions. These rules can be modified to allow for more or fewer restrictions.

Rules: 
- The name must consist of only these characters
   - Letters (a-z or A-Z)
   - Numbers (0-9)
   - Hyphens (-)

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) NFT with authorized contract's locking bytecode as commitment from [Registry Contract](#registry) | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to [Registry Contract](#registry) + tokenAmount from auctionNFT input|
| 1 | Any UTXO from self | Back to self |
| 2 | [AuctionNFT](#auctionnft) | Reward output |

> **Important**: Applications must verify that user added name follows the rules. Failing to do so will result in the auction being invalidated and the user losing their bid amount.

#### DomainOwnershipGuard

This prevents registrations for domains that have already been registered and have owners. Anyone can provide proof of valid ownership([External Auth DomainNFT](#domainnfts)) and burn the auctionNFT and claim the funds as a reward.

Constructor:
- `domainContractBytecode`: The partial bytecode of the domain contract that has an Owner.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) NFT with authorized contract's locking bytecode as commitment from [Registry Contract](#registry) | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to [Registry Contract](#registry) + tokenAmount from auctionNFT input|
| 1 | Any UTXO from self | Back to self |
| 2 | [DomainNFT](#domainnfts) External Auth NFT | [DomainNFT](#domainnfts) External Auth NFT back to the Domain Contract |
| 3 | [AuctionNFT](#auctionnft) | Reward output |

> **Important**: Applications must verify the presence of External Auth NFT in the Domain Contract before creating a new auction. Failing to do so will result in the auction being invalidated and the user losing their funds.

#### AuctionConflictResolver

If two registration auctions exist for the same domain name, the one with the higher registrationID i.e the tokenAmount is invalid. (Since registration is a single-threaded operation such scenarios are unlikely to occur willingly.)

This contract allows anyone to prove that an auction is invalid and burn the invalid auctionNFT in the process and taking away the funds as a reward for keeping the system in check.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) NFT with authorized contract's locking bytecode as commitment from [Registry Contract](#registry) | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to [Registry Contract](#registry) + tokenAmount from auctionNFT input|
| 1 | Any UTXO from self | Back to self |
| 2 | Valid [AuctionNFT](#auctionnft) |  Valid [AuctionNFT](#auctionnft) back to Registry Contract |
| 3 | Invalid [AuctionNFT](#auctionnft) | Reward output |

> **Important**: Applications must verify that an auctionNFT with the same name doesn't already exist in the registry contract before creating a new auction.  Failing to do so will result in the auction being invalidated and the user losing their funds. BCH's UTXO-based system has no concept of 'Contract Storage' to confirm the existence of an ongoing auction.

### Domain

The Domain contract allows the owner to perform a few operations after [DomainNFTs](#domainnfts) are issued from [DomainFactory](#domainfactory). There exists a unique domain contract for each unique domain name.

Constructor:
- `inactivityExpiryTime`: The time in blocks after which the domain is considered abandoned.
- `name`: The name of the domain.
- `domainCategory`: The category of the domain.

There are 3 functions in each Domain Contract:
- **addRecord**: This allows the owner of the domain to add records.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [DomainNFTs](#domainnfts) Internal Auth NFT from self | [DomainNFTs](#domainnfts) Internal Auth NFT returned to self |
| 1 | [DomainNFTs](#domainnfts) Domain ownership NFT from owner | [DomainNFTs](#domainnfts) Domain ownership NFT returned to owner |
| 2 | Funding UTXO (Can come from anywhere) | OP_RETURN containing record data or removal hash |
| 3 |  | BCH change output |

- **externalUse**: This can be called by anyone to prove that the domain is owned.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| x | UTXO from self | Back to self |

- **burn**: This allows the owner of the domain to renounce ownership OR if the domain has been inactive for > `inactivityExpiryTime` then anyone can burn the domain allowing for a new auction.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [DomainNFTs](#domainnfts) Internal Auth NFT | BCH change output |
| 1 | [DomainNFTs](#domainnfts) External Auth NFT | |
| 2 | Pure BCH or [DomainNFTs](#domainnfts) Domain ownership NFT from owner | |


### Accumulator

Once enough auctions have happened, there might come a time when the counterNFT's tokenAmount is not enough to create new Auction NFT. Since the amount would be accumulating in the thread NFTs, this function can be used to transfer them back to the CounterNFT to keep the system functioning smoothly.

Transaction Structure:
| # | Inputs | Outputs |
|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) NFT with authorized contract's locking bytecode as commitment from [Registry Contract](#registry) | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) back to [Registry Contract](#registry) |
| 1 | Any UTXO from self | Back to self |
| 2 | [RegistrationNFTs](#registrationnfts) Counter NFT | [RegistrationNFTs](#registrationnfts) Counter NFT with tokenAmount from input3 |
| 2 | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) Authorized contract's UTXO with tokenAmount | [AuthorizedThreadNFT](#authorizedthreadnfts) without tokenAmount back to [Registry Contract](#registry) |
| 4 | Pure BCH | Change BCH |

### Cashtokens

The contracts talk to each other through cashtokens. There are 4 types in this system:
- [RegistrationNFTs](#registrationnfts)
- [AuctionNFT](#auctionnft)
- [AuthorizedThreadNFTs](#authorizedthreadnfts)
- [DomainNFTs](#domainnfts)

#### RegistrationNFTs
A pair of minting NFTs that reside within the [Registry.cash](#registry) contract, consisting of:
   - **CounterNFT**: This minting hybrid NFT has nftCommitment that starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each new registration. It is also initialized with the maximum possible token amount of `9223372036854775807` that interacts with [Auction.cash](#auction) to facilitate the creation of new auction NFTs. Based on the value of the new registrationID the new minted AuctionNFT gets the exact tokenAmount. [FAQ](#what-if-the-tokenamount-in-the-counternft-runs-out)
      - `category`: domainCategory
      - `commitment`: registrationID < 8 bytes >
      - `tokenAmount`: Keeps reducing with each new registration.
   - **DomainMintingNFT**: A minting NFT that works with [DomainFactory.cash](#domainfactory) to issue new Domain NFTs. This has no nftCommitment or tokenAmount.
      - `category`: domainCategory

#### AuctionNFT
A mutable hybrid NFT created for each new auction that remains within [Registry.cash](#registry), containing comprehensive auction information through the following attributes:
   - `nftCommitment`: A combination of `bidderPKH< 20 bytes > + name < bytes >`
   - `tokenAmount`: This represents the registrationID
   - `capability`: Mutable
   - `satoshis`: The latest bid amount
   - `category`: The designated domainCategory
   A new bid simply updates the `pkh` in the `nftCommitment` and updates the `satoshisValue` to the new amount.

#### AuthorizedThreadNFTs
Each authorized contract's lockingbytecode(Excluding [Domain.cash](#3-domain)) is added to an immutable NFT commitment and sent to the [Registry.cash](#registry) at the time of genesis. These immutable NFTs stay with `Registry.cash` forever. Any interaction with the registry must include one of these thread NFTs to create a transaction.

Structure:
   - `category`: domainCategory
   - `commitment`: lockingbytecode <35 bytes>

The Registry Contract has a designated number of threads for authorized contracts:

x = number of threads [The exact value can be anything but must be decided at the time of genesis as these cannot be created later]

- Auction: ~x threads
- Bid: ~x threads
- DomainFactory: ~x threads
- AuctionNameEnforcer: ~x threads
- DomainOwnershipGuard: ~x threads
- AuctionConflictResolver: ~x threads
- Accumulator: 1 thread (Single threaded operation)

#### DomainNFTs
A set of 3 immutable NFTs minted when an auction ends:
   - **OwnershipNFT**: This NFT proves ownership of a specific domain.
      - `category`: domainCategory
      - `commitment`: registrationID < 8 bytes > + name < bytes >

   - **InternalAuthNFT**: A specialized authorization NFT that resides within the Domain contract and must be used together with the OwnershipNFT to enable the owner's interaction with [Domain.cash](#3-domain).
      - `category`: domainCategory
      - `commitment`: registrationID < 8 bytes >

   - **ExternalAuthNFT**: A specialized authorization NFT that resides within the Domain Contract but can be attached to any transaction, particularly utilized by [DomainOwnershipGuard.cash](#domainownershipguard) to prove existing domain ownership and enforce penalties on illegal auction attempts.
      - `category`: domainCategory

If the domain has been inactive for > `inactivityExpiryTime` then the domain is considered abandoned and anyone can prove the inactivity and burn the Internal and External Auth NFTs to make the domain available for auction.


## TLDs

Top Level Domains (TLDs) like `.bch` and `.sat` do not exist within the contract system directly as a value. Instead, it exists in the AuthChain.

During the genesis phase, the Registry.cash contract is initialized with the `domainCategory`. The `authHead` for this category must include the symbol and name as the TLD, making it accessible to all applications. This entry will be the first and only one in the `authChain`. After this step, the `authHead` must be permanently removed by creating an OP_RETURN output as the first output.

## FAQs

#### How are domains sold?
Domains are sold through an auction. The auction starts using the [Auction](#auction) Contract and is open for new Bids from anyone using the [Bid](#bid) contract. Once no new bids have been made for a `minWaitTime` period, the bidder can claim the domain by using the [DomainFactory](#domainfactory) contract.

#### Can a bid be cancelled?
No, Once a bid is made, it's locked in.

#### Who earns from the auction sales?

Since this is an open protocol, the platform facilitating the interaction can attach their own address to get a percentage of the fee. The percentage of the fee is set in the contract parameters of the [DomainFactory](#domainfactory) contract. The can choose to get any percentage less than `maxPlatformFeePercentage`. Remaining funds are sent to the miners.

#### How do domain or record lookups work?
Let's assume there exists a library called `bitcann.js`. There is how it might look like:

```js
const bitcann = require('bitcann.js');

const domain = bitcann.getDomain('example.bch');
const records = bitcann.getRecords(domain);
```

- `getDomain()` will return the address of the domain contract.
```js
function getDomain(fullName) {
   const name, tld = fullName.split('.')
   const domainCategory = getCategoryForTLD(tld)
   const domainCategoryReversed = binToHex(hexToBin(domainCategory).reverse())
   const scriptHash = buildLockScriptP2SH32(20 +  domainCategoryReversed + pushDataHex(name) + domainContractBytecode)
   const address = lockScriptToAddress(scriptHash)
   return address
}
```

- `getRecords()` will return the records of the domain. Getting the records is as easy as fetching the transaction history of the domain contract and checking the OP_RETURN outputs.


#### Can anyone renounce ownership of a domain?
Yes, The owner must call the `renounceOwnership` function of their respective Domain contract. The function will burn the Internal Auth NFT and the External Auth NFT allowing anyone to initiate a new auction for the domain.

#### What happens to the ownershipNFT when the ownership is renounced or the domain is abandoned?
Since the ownershipNFT's first 8 bytes are registrationID, they cannot influence the domain contract as the new internal Auth NFT will have a different registrationID. The existing ownershipNFT renders useless.

#### How does ownership transfer work? 
Ownership transfer is handled simply by transferring the ownership DomainNFT to the new owner.

#### How to add records?
Each DomainContract has a way to add records. The owner can add new records using the `addRecord` function of the DomainContract. Records are added as OP_RETURN outputs. Records can be found by checking transaction history.

#### How to remove/invalidate records?

Since the records are OP_RETURN it's not possible to remove them. However, it's possible to provide a way that can act as a standard for libraries to understand. To 'invalidate' a Record a new transaction with OP_RETURN(RMV + hash) of record to signal.

#### No Renewal or Expiry?
To prevent domains from being lost indefinitely, the owner must perform at least one activity (such as adding or invalidating records) within the `inactivityExpiryTime` period. Each activity resets the inactivity timer. If the owner does not interact with the domain within the `inactivityExpiryTime`, the system will consider the domain abandoned and make it available for re-auction.
